# Simple-Pokemon-API

This api is a simplified pokemon api based on [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Getting Started

In order to access the hosted api, visit https://simple-pokemon-api.herokuapp.com/pokemon to display all 151 pokemon.

### Features

The simple pokemon api currently obtains information through the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/). However the information is based on the first 151st pokemon (Generation I) and only lists basic information (name, id, weight, and height), typing, abilities, and moveset to simplify fetched information.

### Endpoints

Add any of the following endpoints to access any specific pokemon.

"/:id" define id as any number between 1 and 151 to display the pokemon with the specific id.

"/:name" shows the specific pokemon by name.
